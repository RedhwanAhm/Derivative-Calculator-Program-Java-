# Derivative-Calculator-Program-Java-
This is a program I developed as a final project for my AP Calculus class.
It takes in a String input (function), manipulates it, and then returns the
differentiated output.

As it is uploaded (12-25-18)
 - The AP_Calculus.java file is the main file
 - All the other files are classes.
